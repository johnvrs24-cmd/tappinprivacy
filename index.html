        <h1>TappIn Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>TappIn is a focus app that helps students block distracting apps during study sessions using NFC tags. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how the app works.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>TappIn does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All data stays on your device.</p>
        <p>The app stores the following information locally on your device only:</p>
        <p>— Your selected apps to block (stored using Apple's Screen Time framework)<br>
           — Session history including start time, end time, and duration<br>
           — Basic usage statistics (daily, weekly, monthly focus totals)</p>

        <h2>Screen Time &amp; Family Controls</h2>
        <p>TappIn uses Apple's Screen Time API (FamilyControls, ManagedSettings) to block apps during focus sessions. This data is managed entirely by Apple's framework on your device. TappIn does not have access to your Screen Time data beyond the apps you explicitly select to block.</p>

        <h2>NFC</h2>
        <p>TappIn uses NFC (Near Field Communication) to detect tags and start or end focus sessions. No data from NFC scans is stored or transmitted.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>TappIn does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. There are no ads in the app.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data with third parties. There is no data to share — everything stays on your device.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>TappIn is designed for university students. The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we update this privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page with an updated date.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
